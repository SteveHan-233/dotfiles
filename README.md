# Steve Han's dotfiles
Welcome to my dot files! 
I have included an installation script that should automate the entire installation process for you!
## Usage
Run the installation script with '''zsh bootstrap.sh'''
This should take care of everything. Afterwards, restart your iTerm, change the font to PowerLine, and you are good to go!
