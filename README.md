# Steve Han's dotfiles
Welcome to my dot files! 
I have included an installation script that should automate the entire installation process for you!
## Usage
You can start from a brand new installation of MacOS. Just make sure that you have git installed and iTerm installed.
Then, run the installation script with 

```
zsh bootstrap.sh
```

This should take care of everything. Afterwards, restart your iTerm, change the font to PowerLine, use base16_ command to change the theme, and you are good to go! 

Enjoy your brand new development set up!
